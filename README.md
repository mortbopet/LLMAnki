## Card Analysis Criteria

The AI evaluates cards based on these principles. They are encoded into the system prompt that is sent to the LLM alongside the card content.
The system prompt can be adjusted in the settings to tailor the analysis to your own preferences.

### 1. Unambiguous
The question should have only one reasonable answer. Avoid vague or open-ended questions.

### 2. Atomic
Each card should test exactly one fact or concept. Break complex information into multiple cards.

### 3. Recognizable
Cards should connect to the original context where you learned the information.

### 4. Active Recall
Cards should require genuine recall, not just recognition. The answer shouldn't be guessable from the question.

### Card Type Guidelines

- **Terminology/Definitions**: Use "What is X?" format
- **Description → Term**: Use Jeopardy-style cards
- **Concepts, formulas, lists**: Use cloze deletions

## Development

```bash
# Start dev server with hot reload
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Notes

- API keys are stored locally in your browser's localStorage
- The app runs entirely in your browser - no backend required
- Large decks may take a moment to load as SQLite parsing happens in-browser
